## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I keep trying for 2 days straight and still didn't get it right not from what i thought to be simple.. I was so frustratedðŸ˜‚ ðŸ’” and i know i shouldn't be discouraged i took a break and sort it out on a piece of paper before trying again and it worked. I learned the use of divs and more divs.. this is my first time trying Css positioning i still don't know if i got it right.
